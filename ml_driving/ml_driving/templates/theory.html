          The Theory Test is a Multiple Choice formatted exam and is completed on a
          computer. It is designed to increase knowledge of road safety and rules of the
          road. The pass mark is 43 of 50 questions.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Your instructor will help you with your theory during your lessons to help
          ensure you have the knowledge to pass.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          You can purchase an array of books, DVDs, apps to help you prepare. We recommend
          taking your Theory Test as soon as possible so you can concentrate on the

      <div class="hazard-perception-info">
        <p class="lead">
          The Hazard Perception Test is designed to identify and predict potential dangers
          and hazards on the road, from a drivers perspective. This test will also be
          completed on a computer, clicking the mouse to identify hazards as they appear
          on the screen.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          There are 15 hazards to identify, with a maximum of score of 5 points each (if
          you manage to click the mouse as the hazard starts to develop). The pass mark is
          44 out of 75 points.
